## What this project does:

This CRM Object Sync repository offers guidelines and practical examples to help maintain data consistency and simplify management across multiple platforms.

## Why is this project useful:

This project demonstrates how to:

- Set up HubSpot authentication and generate OAuth access and refresh tokens

- Create and seed a PostgreSQL database with contact records

- Sync of seeded contact records from the database to HubSpot, saving the generated `hs_object_id`Â  back to the database

- Sync contact records from HubSpot to the database:

  - The default sync option uses the Prisma upsert, matching by email. If there is a record match, it just adds the `hs_object_id` to the existing record. If the contact has no email, it creates a new record in the database. The job results will indicate how many records are upsert and the number of new records without email that were created.

  - The second option has more verbose reporting. It tries to create a new record in the database. If there's already a record with a matching email, it adds the `hs_object_id` to the existing record. Contacts without email are just created as normal. The results will indicate the number of records created (with or without email) and the number of existing records that the `hs_object_id` was added to.
 
 ## Getting started with the project:

### Setup:

1. Download and install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), make sure it's running, and create an empty database. You need the username and password (defaults username is postgres and no password)

2. Clone the repo

3. Create the .env file with these entries (see examples in the [.env.example](./.env.example) file):

- DATABASE_URL the (local) url to the postgres database (e.g. `postgresql://{username}:{password}@localhost:5432/{database name}`

- CLIENT_ID from Hubspot public app

- CLIENT_SECRET from Hubspot public app

4. Run `npm install` to install the required Node packages.

5. Run `npm run db-init` to create the necessary tables in PostgreSQL

6. Optional: Run `npm run db-seed` to seed the database with test data

7. In your [HubSpot public app](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/creating-an-app), add `localhost:3000/oauth-callback` as a redirect URL

8. The app uses the following scopes:

- `crm.objects.contacts.read`
- `crm.objects.contacts.write`
- `crm.objects.companies.read`
- `crm.objects.companies.write`
- `crm.schemas.contacts.read`
- `crm.schemas.contacts.write`
- `crm.schemas.companies.read`
- `crm.schemas.companies.write`

9. Run `npm run dev` to start the server

10. Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/install` in a browser to get the OAuth install link

### Scopes

- `crm.objects.contacts.read`
- `crm.objects.contacts.write`
- `crm.objects.companies.read`
- `crm.objects.companies.write`
- `crm.schemas.contacts.read`
- `crm.schemas.contacts.write`
- `crm.schemas.companies.read`
- `crm.schemas.companies.write`
- `oauth`

## Endpoints:
### Authentication Endpoints

- `GET /api/install`: Sends a simple HTML response containing a link (authUrl) for users to authenticate. The link opens in a new tab when clicked. This should be the first step a new user or client performs to initiate the OAuth2 authorization process.

- `GET /oauth-callback`: It processes the authorization code to obtain an access token for the user and any failure in retrieving it redirects with an error message.

- `GET /` : Once authenticated, the access token can be retrieved using this endpoint. This ensures that any subsequent API operations requiring authentication can be performed.

### Synchronization Endpoints

- `GET /initial-contacts-sync`: After establishing authentication and obtaining an access token, the initial **synchronization of contacts from HubSpot to the local database** can occur.

- `GET /contacts`: This endpoint fetches contacts from the local database.

- `GET /sync-contacts`: This is used to **synchronize any updates or new contact data from the local database to HubSpot**. Email is used as a primary key for logical deduplication, making it crucial that email addresses are correctly managed and non-null where possible. To minimize errors, we first retrieve existing contacts from HubSpot and exclude those already known from our batch. The following methods are employed to send new contacts to HubSpot and to store their HubSpot object IDs back in our local database.
